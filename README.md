# My-App
Typescript React Login Form without Endpoint API

I was having some trouble with the dev enviroment was set up for me, something wrong with my computer from what I can gauge, so I install a fresh version of typescript and react to work with.

I hope that is ok.

Once you have pulled this to your computer cd into the project and run an npm install to install the nodes. 

For some reason I coudn't get it to compile my used packages, my computer needs to be replaced, it has issues =[
